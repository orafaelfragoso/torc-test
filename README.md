## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic form in React with TypeScript. It features a flexible configuration system for form fields and leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, along with the additional utility classes provided by DaisyUI. The form state is managed using the Context API to make it accessible from any component within the application.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **components/**: Houses the `DynamicForm.tsx` component and any other custom components.
  - **App.tsx**: The main application component where the form configuration is defined.
  - **main.tsx**: The entry point of the React application.
  - **index.css**: Contains global styles and imports Tailwind CSS.
- **public/**: Contains public assets and the HTML template for the application.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.
- **package.json**: Node.js package file.
- **...**: Other project configuration files.
